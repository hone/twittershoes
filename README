TwitterShoes 
============

ruby script created to be a Twitter (http://www.twitter.com) client, 
that uses Shoes.rb (http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes) to be run 
on various platforms (Linux, MacOSX, Windows). Shoes.rb is a winner !!

Please have Shoes installed on your operating system of choice.
The original idea was to create a simple Twitter client based on the intention
of testing Shoes.rb

Please feel free to give a hand and produce some code, review it, fix bugs, etc.
