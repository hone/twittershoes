= TwitterShoes

* http://github.com/hone/twittershoes

== DESCRIPTION:

ruby script created to be a Twitter (http://www.twitter.com) client, 
that uses Shoes.rb (http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes) to be run 
on various platforms (Linux, MacOSX, Windows). Shoes.rb is a winner !!

Please feel free to give a hand and produce some code, review it, fix bugs, etc.

In this fork, I've started some work to hide the twitter password on disk.  In the future I plan to add some UI features to request the user for a login/password.

The Current implementation

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Shoes.rb (http://github.com/why/shoes) installed on your operating system of choice.

== INSTALL:

* make a directory '.twittershoes' in your $HOME directory.
* inside this directory, run this command and keep track of the password: openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
* extract the public key: openssl rsa -in private.pem -out public.pem -outform PEM -pubout
* make sure the public.pem and private.pem are in your .twittershoes directory
* copy all *.rb files to a folder of yours
* fill in username / password at the beginning of the twittershoes.rb
* open twittershoes.rb using Shoes
* after first run, can clear the username/password
